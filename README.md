###### What is this?
A 8bit real time clock for old computers. Keeps the time when the computer is shut down.

###### Why is this?
Yes, there are many more modern RTC's out there. I made this just for fun and with parts that were readily available back in the 80s. I like to keep things period correct ðŸ˜‰

###### How to use it?
First set the jumpers for the RTC. You can choose between 200h, 240h, 300h and 340h.
